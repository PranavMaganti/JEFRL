    "CVE-2008-6994\tStack-based buffer overflow in the SaveAs feature (SaveFileAsWithFilter function) in win_util.cc in Google Chrome 0.2.149.27 allows user-assisted remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a web page with a long TITLE element, which triggers the overflow when the user saves the page and a long filename is generated. NOTE: it might be possible to exploit this issue via an HTTP response that includes a long filename in a Content-Disposition header.\n",
    "CVE-2008-5915\tAn unspecified function in the JavaScript implementation in Google Chrome creates and exposes a \"temporary footprint\" when there is a current login to a web site, which makes it easier for remote attackers to trick a user into acting upon a spoofed pop-up message, aka an \"in-session phishing attack.\" NOTE: as of 20090116, the only disclosure is a vague pre-advisory with no actionable information. However, because it is from a well-known researcher, it is being assigned a CVE identifier for tracking purposes.\n",

NOTE: a third party disputes this issue, stating that Chrome \"will ask for user permission\" and \"cannot launch the applet even [if] you have given out the permission.\"\n",
    "CVE-2008-4724\tMultiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Google Chrome 0.2.149.30 allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via an ftp:// URL for an HTML document within a (1) JPG, (2) PDF, or (3) TXT file. NOTE: the provenance of this information is unknown; the details are obtained solely from third party information.\n",
    "CVE-2008-4340\tGoogle Chrome 0.2.149.29 and 0.2.149.30 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via an HTML document containing a carriage return (\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\") argument to the window.open function.\n",
